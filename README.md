# About Me

I'm a motivated self-started with over two decades of combined experience in a wealth of
technologies. For more info why not [check my portfolio out live](https://strutcode.dev)?

# About This Project

This project encompasses the sources of my portfolio site. It's a static single page
application built around Vue 3 and WebGL

## Technology

This portfolio represents a collection of a few of my favorite technologies that I felt
suit the purpose well. Below is a short list with explanation of my reasoning for each.

**Bun**

As an all-in-one Javascript environment, I find Bun to be easier to manage compared to
individual applications for each purpose such as Node.js/Yarn/Jest.

**TypeScript**

If I'm going to work in a browser ecosystem TypeScript is always my language of choice.
The minimal deviation from existing JavaScript APIs combined with practical static type
checking make it a long time favorite.

**Vite**

One of my favorite tools as a low configuration and feature-rich layer on top of the
fabulous `esbuild` core. It makes setup painless and lets me focus on rapid development.

**Vue**

Hands down the best reactive frontend framework out there. I find it to be the best
compromise between the openness and inefficiency of React versus the raw speed but rigidity
of something like Svelte.

**Biome + Prettier**

I like to be clean even with personal projects, which means having good formatting and
linting rules. Biome is a convenient easy to configure alternative to the classic ESLint
when the large ecosystem isn't as necessary.

Similarly, Prettier provides pretty good formatting with just enough available configuration
for smaller code bases.

**TWGL.js**

WebGL is fun and makes for some very visually interesting effects. TWGL.js is my favorite
framework to use for small projects purpose as it provides a huge amount of utility given its
tiny footprint of just a few kilobytes.
